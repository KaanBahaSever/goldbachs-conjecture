# Goldbach's Conjecture

This repository contains an optimized implementation of Goldbach's Conjecture in C++.

## Goldbach's Conjecture

Goldbach's Conjecture is one of the oldest unsolved problems in number theory and mathematics. It asserts that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

## Implementation

The code in this repository is a C++ implementation of Goldbach's Conjecture. The goal is to check if a given even number can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang`)
- CMake (optional, if you want to use the provided CMake configuration)

## Build and Run

To compile and run the code, you can use the following steps:

### Using g++

```sh
g++ -o goldbach goldbach.cpp
./goldbach
